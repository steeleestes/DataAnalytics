# DataAnalytics
Currently in the process of formalizing my knowledge of data analytics and doing it programatically/alogrithmically instead of manually. This repo is where I am keeping random docs related to the learning journey for things like SQL, Seaborn / MathPlotLib, and Pandas. 
The purpose of this is to gain employable fluency in all things data analytics on the way to the thing I am passionate about and deeply interested in - data science.
